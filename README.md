> A minimum example of using Gatsby to build a modern webapp with react, typescript and many other things

#### Highlights

This example will show you how to

- **write a complete typescript app with gatsby**: all files, even including `gatsby-*` APIs
- **write tests with jest**: components and pages
- **reference files as a module**: e.g. use syntax like `#components/my-component` instead of `../components/my-component`
- **analyse bundle size**: get a report on the bundle at the end of the build process
- **generate types for GraphQL queries**: via apollo during the dev/build life cycle

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install
```

In order to use auth0 as your user management system, you must supply the following environment variables:

1. GATSBY_AUTH0_DOMAIN
2. GATSBY_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID

## Limitation

- Currently types for GraphQL queries is generated only when the devlop/build life cycle script is executed.
  Any change to the query while running devlop would not be picked up since Gatsby does not has a hook for the HMR process.
  Therefore, no type will be generated on-the-fly.
  Re-run the build/devlop to update the type files if it is needed.

## Setup Auth0 Environment

1.  Create a talent via the top right account menu
    - **Recommended**: Make separate talents for your development and production environments
    - Note: A talent is a pool of users that your applications can access
2.  Go to `Applications` and click `Create Application`
3.  Name the application (e.g. SPA Login) and select `Single Page Web Applications`
4.  Enter the allowed web origins, callback & logout URLs
    - if you are in development mode, the URLs are http://localhost:8000
5.  Try to customise others settings

## About

Perhaps there is no short of example on how to use typescript with Gatsby,
but I haven't come across an example that really uses typescript everywhere,
let alone telling me how to automatically generate types for GraphQL queries.

I make this example as part of my frontend research.
I don't anticipate anyone would use it besides me, but just in case you do, feel free. ;)
